# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.

### json-server模拟从后端获取数据的步骤

#### 安装或者全局安装一下json-server

#### 在项目根目录创建，data.json文件，在data.json中添加模拟数据，json格式

- data.json文件中，最外层必须是{}
- 若用到数组，可以适当转换一下，{"list":[{},{},{},……]}

#### 启动json-server

- 使用命令1： json-server --watch data.json
- 为了避免和当前项目端口冲突，可以再package.json中scripts中添加一个serve;例如："serve":"json-server data.json --port
  3004"
- 当前数据的接口地址，就是命令1在终端启动后，resources中显示的打开地址，就是前端aixios要请求的地址；例如：Resources
  http://localhost:3004/list

### 前端中浏览器向json-server发起请求，使用在node或者浏览器中都通用的axios

- npm i axios -D
